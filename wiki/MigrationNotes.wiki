===Migration from release 0.3 to 0.4 ===
With release 0.4, I added some new options and marked some other as deprecated (still working, but removed in next release). You can compare documentations: UserDocs03 and UserDocs04

Working 0.3 releases, should work correctly out of the box with 0.4 version, but I recommend to follow next instructions to ensure future compatibility:

 * coming soon...

===Migration from release 0.2 to 0.3 ===
With release 0.3, a lot of default options are changed. You can compare options: UserDocs02 and UserDocs03

If you have a working release 0.2, please be sure to follow next steps in order to preserve your script behaviour:

 * if not just setted, set "collapseAllButton: 'Collapse All'"
 * if not just setted, set "expandAllButton: 'Expande All'"
 * if not just setted, set "collapseEffect: 'slide'"
 * if not just setted, set "expandEffect: 'slide'"
