===Migration from release 0.2 to 0.3 ===
With release 0.3, a lot of default options are changed. You can compare options: UserDocs02 and UserDocs03

If you have a working release 0.2, please be sure to follow next steps in order to preserve your script behaviour:

 * if not just setted, set "collapseAllButton: 'Collapse All'"
 * if not just setted, set "expandAllButton: 'Expande All'"
 * if not just setted, set "collapseEffect: 'slide'"
 * if not just setted, set "expandEffect: 'slide'"
 * if not just setted, set "collapseImage: 'images/minus.png'"
 * if not just setted, set "expandImage: 'images/plus.png'"
 * if not just setted, set "leafImage: 'images/blank.png'"
